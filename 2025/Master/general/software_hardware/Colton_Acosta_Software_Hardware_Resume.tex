October 2023--Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{ Responsible Engineer for a gyroscope that provides inputs to bending compensation algorithms on Starship Booster }
\item{ Responsible Engineer for an engineering camera used to stream video of key events in flight to inform design }
\item{ Conducted environmental testing including thermal cycling, vibration, shock, leak, humidity, and radiation}
\item{ Developed and released PCBs and avionics designs using Altium for schematic capture and layout}
\item{ Reduced cost per vehicle stack by more than 150k by developing new technologies for rocket usage such as MEMs gyroscopes, video encoder ASICs, and cutting edge image sensors }
\item{ Doubled camera yield by root causing production test failures such as boot failures, loss of streams, and corrupted video packets}
\item{ Wrote Python scripts to scrub vehicle data from company databases and analyze hardware performance }
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Raytheon Missiles and Defense: Software Engineer}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
July 2023--October 2023
\begin{itemize}
\item{Implemented new features for a .NET based WebUI used for automating software (SIL), computer (CIL), and hardware (HIL) in the loop missile tests using C\# and Javascript}
\item{Wrote a C\# method to automatically locate library dll files to eliminate the need for manually setting the path}
\item{Added a new page to the WebUI for monitoring background test status by querying the API using HTTP requests}
\item{Added Javascript keyboard event listeners user interface to implement quit and save keyboard shortcuts}
\end{itemize}

\section{PROJECTS}
\textbf{Sun Devil Rocketry: Flight Computer}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
January 2021--Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Developed a flight computer to log flight data and implement parachute recovery in amateur and high power rockets}
\item{Equipped the computer with an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, a pressure sensor, external flash, and USB}
\item{Wrote hardware drivers in C to abstract low level control of hardware UART, I2C, SPI, and GPIO interfacing}
\item{Wrote a data-logger application to collect flight data, and successfully recovered flight data from several launches}
\item{Implemented the recovery software using a state machine architecture to transition between programming, idle, in-flight, and post-flight states}
\item{Implemented apogee detection, main parachute altitude detection, and landing detection algorithms using a FIFO buffer, Z-transforms, and tuned thresholds}
