October 2023--Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{ Responsible Engineer for a gyroscope that provides inputs to bending compensation algorithms on Starship Booster }
\item{ Responsible Engineer for an engineering camera used to stream video of key events in flight to inform design }
\item{ Conducted environmental testing including thermal cycling, vibration, shock, leak, humidity, and radiation }
\item{ Developed and released PCBs and avionics designs using Altium for schematic capture and layout}
\item{ Reduced cost per vehicle stack by more than 150k by developing new technologies for rocket usage such as MEMs gyroscopes, video encoder ASICs, and cutting edge image sensors }
\item{ Doubled camera yield by root causing production test failures such as boot failures, loss of streams, and corrupted video packets}
\item{ Brought up new PCB designs by testing power trees, serial interfaces, and sensors using oscilloscopes and multimeters }
\item{ Coordinated product development by communicating with production, supply chain, and engineering }
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Raytheon Missiles and Defense: Software Engineer}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
July 2023--October 2023
\begin{itemize}
\item{Implemented new features for a .NET based WebUI used for automating software (SIL), computer (CIL), and hardware (HIL) in the loop missile tests using C\# and Javascript}
\item{Wrote a C\# method to automatically locate library dll files to eliminate the need for manually setting the path}
\item{Added a new page to the WebUI for monitoring background test status by querying the API using HTTP requests}
\item{Added Javascript keyboard event listeners user interface to implement quit and save keyboard shortcuts}
\end{itemize}

\hfill 
\vspace{0.5em}
May 2021--August 2021
\begin{itemize}
\item{Revised a switching power supply and serial opto-isolator PCB to be usable with multiple bill acceptors}
\item{Designed a new PCB to protect test fixture pins from overvoltage and overcurrent conditions
	using schottky diodes and a PTC resettable fuse}
\item{Added serial indication LEDs, signal buffering, inrush current protection, and short circuit protection to a USB to MDB serial interface PCB}
\item{Designed a revised bill acceptor software development board by adding an electronic fuse to alleviate faulty sup-
	ply/loading conditions and provide power supply fault indication}
\item{Performed DC load testing on a new 120V AC power supply to measure power trace voltage drops at full load}
