\textbf{Garmin Aviation: Embedded Software Engineering Intern}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
May 2022--August 2022
\begin{itemize}
\item{Developed certification software for a new Vulkan graphics driver to be used in safety-critical avionics systems}
\item{Wrote unit tests with randomized test vectors in C to test the GPU driver source code with maximal coverage}
\item{Debugged compiler errors of ARM and Windows builds using Visual Studio and MSBuild XML schemas}
\item{Resolved runtime errors caused by randomized test vectors by analyzing the source code functions and manually setting up data structures, pointers, arrays, and buffers}
\end{itemize}

\section{PROJECTS}
\textbf{Sun Devil Rocketry: Flight Computer}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
January 2021--Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Developed a flight computer to log flight data and implement parachute recovery in amateur and high power rockets}
\item{Equipped the computer with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, a barometric pressure sensor, external flash, and a USB interface}
\item{Wrote APIs in C for low level control of external hardware using UART, I2C, SPI, and GPIO}
\item{Wrote a data-logger application to collect flight data, and successfully recovered flight data from several launches}
\item{Implemented the recovery software using a state machine architecture to transition between programming, idle, in-flight, and post-flight states}
\item{Implemented apogee detection, main parachute altitude detection, and landing detection algorithms using a FIFO buffer, Z-transforms, and tuned thresholds}
\end{itemize}
