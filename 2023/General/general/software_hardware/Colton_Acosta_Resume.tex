\textbf{Raytheon Missiles and Defense: Software Engineer I}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
July 2023--Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Implemented new features for a .NET based WebUI used for automating software (SIL), computer (CIL), and hardware (HIL) in the loop missile tests using C\# and Javascript}
\item{Wrote a C\# method to automatically locate library dll files to eliminate the need for manually setting the path}
\item{Added a new page to the WebUI for monitoring background test status by querying the API using HTTP requests}
\item{Added Javascript keyboard event listeners to results pages to implement quit and save keyboard shortcuts}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Garmin Aviation: Embedded Software Engineering Intern}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
May 2022--August 2022
\begin{itemize}
\item{Developed certification software for a new Vulkan graphics driver to be used in safety-critical avionics systems}
\item{Wrote unit tests with randomized test vectors in C to test the GPU driver source code with maximal coverage}
\item{Debugged compiler errors of ARM and Windows builds using Visual Studio and MSBuild XML schemas}
\item{Resolved runtime errors caused by randomized test vectors by analyzing the source code functions and manually setting up data structures, pointers, arrays, and buffers}
\end{itemize}

\section{PROJECTS}
\textbf{Sun Devil Rocketry: Flight Computer}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
January 2021--Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Developed a flight computer to log flight data and implement parachute recovery in amateur and high power rockets}
\item{Equipped the computer with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, a barometric pressure sensor, external flash, and a USB interface}
\item{Wrote APIs in C for low level control of external hardware using UART, I2C, SPI, and GPIO}
\item{Implemented the recovery software using a state machine architecture to transition between programming, idle, in-flight, and post-flight states}
\item{Implemented apogee detection, main parachute altitude detection, and landing detection algorithms using a FIFO buffer, Z-transforms, and tuned thresholds}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sun Devil Rocketry: Liquid Rocket Engine Controller}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
August 2019--May 2023
\begin{itemize}
\item{Architected an avionics system which successfully supported ASU's first static hotfire attempt of a liquid rocket engine}
\item{Designed and built an engine controller for to manage engine hardware and communicate with the ground station}
\item{Designed the PCB using an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, a switching power supply, external flash, an SD card, ignition terminals, sensor peripherals, a USB interface, and an RS485 command and control interface}
\item{Programmed a Python interface for real-time visualization of engine state and sensor measurements}
\item{Wrote sequencing code in C to open/close engine values in a timed order to automate a static hotfire test }
\item{Wrote an interrupt driven command processor to communicate with the remote ground station over ethernet}
