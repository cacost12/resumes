\textbf{Sun Devil Rocketry: Liquid Propulsion Team Lead}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
August 2019-Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Leading a multidisciplinary team of nine students to design and develop a liquid bipropellant rocket engine}
	\item{Designing an avionics system to monitor and manage all engine hardware including including valves, transducers, thermocouples, load cells, motor drivers, transceivers, and signal processing circuitry}
	\item{Designing an instrumentation amplifier PCB with digitally programmable gain to boost available transducer outputs to measurable ranges in order to save upwards of 10\% of club funding in transducer costs} 
\item{Designed an embedded engine controller PCB including an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, a switching power supply, an embedded flash memory/micro SD card data logger, and GPIO connectors}
	\item{Designed and built a second order, active low-pass filter and tested the filter's noise reduction and signal reproduction by adding noise to a measured signal with a voltage summing circuit}
\item{Designing an actuation interface for the engine's AC powered flow control solenoids using solid state relays}

\section{PROJECTS}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Flow Control Valve Actuator Control System}\hfill Fall 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and built a closed loop control system for a valve actuator for use in flow throttling applications
	\item Examined the relationship between Pulse Width Modulation duty cycle and steady state shaft speed to derive a controller output signal with a linear transfer function from controller output to shaft position  
	\item Characterized the plant transfer function with a series of step response experiments
	\item  Designed and simulated a saturated PI controller with integrator clamping using Simulink to meet performance specifications of zero steady state error of step inputs and complete rejection of step disturbances.
	\item  Built the actuator control system using a brushed DC motor, coupling shaft, Arduino controller, and quadrature rotary encoder for feedback.
