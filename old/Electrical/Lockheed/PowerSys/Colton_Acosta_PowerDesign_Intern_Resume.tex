\vspace{0.5em}
August 2019-Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Leading a multidisciplinary team of nine engineering students to design and develop a liquid bipropellant rocket engine}
	\item{Designing an avionics system to monitor and manage all engine hardware including valves, transducers, thermocouples, load cells, motor drivers, transceivers, and signal processing circuitry}
\item{Designed an embedded engine controller PCB including an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, a switching power supply, an embedded flash memory/micro SD card data logger, and GPIO connectors}
	\item{Designing an instrumentation amplifier PCB with digitally programmable gain to boost sensor outputs to measurable ranges in order to save upwards of 10\% of overall club funding in sensor costs}
	\item{Building a central telemetry system using RS-485 electrical interfaces for long distance and noise insensitive serial communications between data acquisition, valve control, and main controllers}
	\item{Designed and built a second order, active low-pass filter and tested the filter's noise reduction and signal reproduction by adding noise to a measured signal with a voltage summing circuit}
\item{Designing an actuation interface for the engine's AC powered flow control solenoids using solid state relays}
	\item{Documented project progress in published AIAA Propulsion and Energy conference paper}

\section{PROJECTS}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Flow Control Valve Actuator Control System}\hfill Fall 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {Designed and built a closed loop control system for a valve actuator for use in flow throttling applications}
	\item {Examined the relationship between Pulse Width Modulation duty cycle and steady state shaft speed to derive a controller output signal with a linear transfer function from controller output to shaft position} 
	\item {Characterized the plant transfer function with a series of step response experiments}
 \item  {Implemented a saturated PI controller with integrator clamping in C++, and simulated the performance using Simulink to meet specifications of zero steady state error of step inputs and complete rejection of step disturbances}
	\item  {Built the actuator control system using a brushed DC motor, coupling shaft, Arduino controller, and a quadrature rotary encoder for feedback}
