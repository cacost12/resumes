\hfill 
\vspace{0.5em}
May 2021-August 2021
\begin{itemize}
\item{Evaluated bill validation errors of a Pyramid bill acceptor in firmware using an in-circuit debugger with the calibration source code, written in coldfire assembly.}
\item{Conducted phototransistor data collection and analysis with over 150 LEDs to find a viable replacement bill validation LED that would work at scale production with minimal firmware modifications}
\item{Designed a revised bill acceptor software development board by adding an electronic fuse to alleviate faulty supply/loading conditions and provide power supply fault indication}
\item{Designed a revised USB to MDB serial converter PCB adding serial indication LEDs, signal buffering, inrush current protection, and short circuit protection to the original design}
\item{Wrote Python scripts to calculate external component design values from input specifications and datasheet guidelines}

\section{PROJECTS}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Flow Control Valve Actuator Control System}\hfill Fall 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and built a closed loop control system for a valve actuator for use in flow throttling applications
	\item Examined the relationship between Pulse Width Modulation duty cycle and steady state shaft speed to derive a controller output signal with a linear transfer function from controller output to shaft position  
	\item Characterized the plant transfer function with a series of step response experiments
	\item  Implemented a saturated PI controller with integrator clamping in C++, and simulated the performance using Simulink to meet specifications of zero steady state error of step inputs and complete rejection of step disturbances.
	\item  Built the actuator control system using a brushed DC motor, coupling shaft, Arduino controller, and quadrature rotary encoder for feedback.
