August 2019-Present
\begin{itemize}
\item{Managing a technical student organization with over 50 members by overseeing engineering projects, organizing events and meetings, writing budgeting plans, mentoring, and maintaining industry/university relations}
	\item{Developing an avionics system for a liquid rocket engine to manage all engine hardware including valves, transducers, thermocouples, load cells, motor drivers, wireless transceivers, and signal processing circuitry}
\item{Designing an embedded engine controller PCB including an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, a switching power supply, an external flash and SD card data logger, and an ignition system}
	\item{Programming ARM Cortex microcontrollers with C and assembly using CMSIS HAL drivers for low level software control of data acquisition, actuation, flow control, and communications hardware}
	\item{Programming a Python user interface for real-time visualization of temperature, pressure, thrust, and flow measurements}
	\item{Designing an instrumentation amplifier PCB with digitally programmable gain to boost available sensor outputs to measurable ranges in order to save upwards of 10\% of club funding in new sensor costs}
	\item{Designed and built a second order, active low-pass filter and tested the filter's noise reduction and signal reproduction by adding noise to a measured signal with a voltage summing circuit}
\item{Designed a valve controller PCB to control AC powered solenoids and stepper motors using an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller, solid state relays, an optically-isolated AC supply monitoring circuit, and calibration sensor inputs}
\end{itemize}
\section{PROJECTS}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Flow Control Valve Actuator Control System}\hfill Fall 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and built a closed loop control system for a valve actuator for use in flow throttling applications
	\item Examined the relationship between Pulse Width Modulation duty cycle and steady state shaft speed to derive a controller output signal with a linear transfer function from controller output to shaft position  
	\item Characterized the plant transfer function with a series of step response experiments
	\item  Implemented a saturated PI controller with integrator clamping in C++, and simulated the performance using Simulink to meet specifications of zero steady state error of step inputs and complete rejection of step disturbances.
	\item  Built the actuator control system using a brushed DC motor, coupling shaft, Arduino controller, and quadrature rotary encoder for feedback.
