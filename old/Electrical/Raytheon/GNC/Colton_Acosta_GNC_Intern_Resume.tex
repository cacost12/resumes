\section{PROJECTS}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Flow Control Valve Actuator Control System}\hfill Fall 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and built a closed loop control system for a valve actuator for use in flow throttling applications
	\item Examined the relationship between Pulse Width Modulation duty cycle and steady state shaft speed to derive a controller output signal with a linear transfer function from controller output to shaft position  
	\item Characterized the plant transfer function with a series of step response experiments
	\item  Designed and simulated a saturated PI controller with integrator clamping using Simulink to meet performance specifications of zero steady state error of step inputs and complete rejection of step disturbances.
	\item  Built the actuator control system using a brushed DC motor, coupling shaft, Arduino controller, and quadrature rotary encoder for feedback.
