\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lead a group of seven students to complete a semester long project by devising a project plan, delegating workloads, setting timelines, and scheduling team meetings
	\item Collected computational aerodynamic data with ANSYS for airflow over a wing section with configurable design specifications created with SOLIDWORKS from an airfoil parameterization
	\item Analyzed data with an ANOVA test and computed significance-based regression models using R 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Honors Student, Trans-lunar Injection Simulation} 
\hfill
Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulated a free-return, trans-lunar injection orbital trajectory in MATLAB
	\item Calculated the trajectory by solving the two-body problem using numerical differential equation solvers with Apollo 11 low earth orbit initial conditions, and animated the solution to visualize the trajectory
