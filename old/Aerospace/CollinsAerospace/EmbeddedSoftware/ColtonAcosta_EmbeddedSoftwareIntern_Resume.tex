\section{PROJECTS}
\textbf{Flow Control Valve Actuator Control System}\hfill Fall 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and built a closed loop control system for valve actuation in flow throttling applications
	\item Examined the relationship between pulse width modulation duty cycle and steady state shaft speed to derive a controller output signal with a linear transfer function from controller output to shaft position  
	\item Characterized the plant transfer function with a series of step response experiments
	\item  Designed and simulated a saturated PI controller with integrator clamping using Simulink with performance specifications of zero steady state error of step inputs and complete rejection of step disturbances.
	\item  Built the actuator control system using a brushed DC motor, coupling shaft, Arduino controller, and quadrature rotary encoder for feedback.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5280 Team Member, Sun Devil Rocketry}
\hfill Fall 2018-Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collaborated with a group of 12 students to launch an amateur rocket to an altitude of 5280 feet
	\item Determined build specifications, apogee altitude, and static margin with OpenRocket software
	\item Constructed rocket with phenolic tubing wrapped with epoxied fiberglass fabric and laser-cut fins 
	\item Adjusted final build to pragmatically mitigate static margin calculation error, allowing rocket to be launched on time
	\item Used a microcontroller breakout board with internal altimeter for parachute deployment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Orbital Mechanics Trans-lunar Injection Simulation} 
\hfill
Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulated a free-return, trans-lunar injection orbital trajectory in MATLAB with an animated solution
	\item Calculated the trajectory by solving the two-body problem using a numerical differential equation solver built from scratch with Apollo 11 low earth orbit initial conditions
