\textbf{5280 Team Member, Sun Devil Rocketry}
\hfill Fall 2018-Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collaborated with a group of 12 students to launch an amateur rocket to an altitude of 5280 feet
	\item Determined build specifications, apogee altitude, and static margin with OpenRocket software
	\item Constructed rocket with phenolic tubing wrapped with epoxied fiberglass fabric and laser-cut fins 
	\item Pragmatically adjusted final build to mitigate static margin error, allowing rocket to be launched on time
	\item Used a microcontroller breakout board with internal altimeter for parachute deployment
\end{itemize}
\section{ACADEMIC PROJECTS}

\textbf{Honors Student, Analog Filter Circuit Design Simulation}\hfill Spring 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determined the component impedances for a Sallen-Key active filter network with a 600 Hz cutoff frequency without resonance
	\item Used MATLAB built tools for transfer functions and system response to simulate the filtering of a noisy audio signal
	\item Considered the trade off between signal attenuation and quality preservation
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Honors Student, Trans-lunar Injection Simulation} 
\hfill
Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulated a free-return, trans-lunar injection orbital trajectory in MATLAB with an animated solution
	\item Calculated the trajectory by solving the two-body problem using a numerical differential equation solver built from scratch with Apollo 11 low earth orbit initial conditions
\end{itemize}
