\section{PROJECTS}
\textbf{Team Lead, Airfoil Statistics Project}\hfill Spring 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lead a group of seven students to complete a semester long project by devising a project plan, delegating workloads, setting timelines, and scheduling team meetings
	\item Collected computational aerodynamic data with Ansys for airflow over a wing section with configurable design specifications created with SOLIDWORKS from a NACA 2412 airfoil parameterization
	\item Used R programming to analyze data with an Analysis of Variance test and to compute significance-based regression models for wing section lift and drag response to chord length, angle of attack, and sweep angle factors
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Orbital Mechanics Trans-lunar Injection Simulation} 
\hfill
Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulated a free-return, trans-lunar injection orbital trajectory in MATLAB with an animated solution
	\item Calculated the trajectory by solving the two-body problem using a numerical differential equation solver built from scratch with Apollo 11 low earth orbit initial conditions
\end{itemize}

\section{EXPERIENCE}
\textbf{Liquid Propulsion Avionics Lead, Sun Devil Rocketry}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
August 2019-Present
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Leading the design and development of an avionics system for a liquid rocket engine with over 20 hardware components including valves, transducers, thermocouples, load cells, controllers, and signal processing circuitry}
	\item{Interfacing temperature, pressure, thrust, and flow measurements with a Python graphical user interface}
	\item{Conducting trade studies on electronic actuators and orifice flow meters to develop main propulsion system specifications using MATLAB for multivariate trade-off analyses and physical modeling}
	\item{Programming AVR microcontrollers with C for prototype testing of the engine's embedded systems including data acquisition, actuation, flow control, and communications functionality}
	\item{Wrote a C++ program to generate Gaussian noise for hardware filter testing by writing an algorithm for computing values of an inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution function}
	\item{Wrote a C program to encode the state of the engine's valves using bit operators for efficient serial data transmission}
	\item{Built an instrumentation amplifier circuit using operational amplifiers to boost sensor outputs to measurable ranges resulting in hardware savings upwards of \$200}
	\item{Building a central telemetry system using RS-485 electrical interfaces for long distance and noise insensitive serial communications between data acquisition, valve control, and main controllers}
	\item{Designed and built a second order, active low-pass filter and tested the filter's noise reduction and signal reproduction by adding noise to a measured signal with a voltage summing circuit}
	\item{Documented project progress in published AIAA Propulsion and Energy conference paper}
	\item{Wrote a development plan for the 2020-2021 academic year consisting of 42 deliverables to document project milestones, cultivate a results-oriented work environment, and delegate workloads among new talent}
