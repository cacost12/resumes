\section{EXPERIENCE}
\textbf{Liquid Propulsion Avionics Lead, Sun Devil Rocketry}
\hfill
\vspace{0.5em}
August 2019-Present
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Leading the design and development of an integrated avionics system for a liquid rocket engine with over 20 hardware components including valves, sensors, controllers, and signal processing circuitry}
	\item{Documented project progress in published AIAA Propulsion and Energy conference paper}
	\item{Built a signal amplifier to boost sensor outputs to measurable ranges resulting in savings upwards of \$200}
	\item{Wrote a development plan for the 2020-2021 academic year consisting of 42 deliverables to document project milestones, cultivate a results-oriented work environment, and delegate workloads among new talent}
	\item{Interfacing temperature, pressure, thrust, and flow measurements with a Python graphical user interface}
	\item{Conducting trade studies on electronic actuators and orifice flow meters to develop main propulsion system specifications using MATLAB for multivariate trade-off analyses}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}
\textbf{5280 Team Member, Sun Devil Rocketry}
\hfill Fall 2018-Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collaborated with a team of 12 students to launch an amateur rocket to an altitude of 5280 feet
	\item Determined build specifications, apogee altitude, and static margin with OpenRocket software
	\item Constructed rocket with phenolic tubing wrapped with epoxied fiberglass fabric and laser-cut fins 
	\item Adjusted final build to pragmatically mitigate static margin calculation error, allowing rocket to be launched on time
	\item Used a microcontroller breakout board with internal altimeter for parachute deployment
\end{itemize}
\section{ACADEMIC PROJECTS}

\textbf{Team Lead, Airfoil Statistics Project}\hfill Spring 2020
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lead a group of seven students to complete a semester long project by devising a project plan, delegating workloads, setting timelines, and scheduling team meetings
	\item Collected computational aerodynamic data with ANSYS for airflow over a wing section with configurable design specifications created with SolidWorks from a NACA 2412 airfoil parameterization
	\item Used R programming to analyze data with an Analysis of Variance test and to compute significance-based regression models for wing section lift and drag response to chord length, angle of attack, and sweep angle factors
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Honors Student, Trans-lunar Injection Simulation} 
\hfill
Spring 2019
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulated a free-return, trans-lunar injection orbital trajectory in MATLAB with an animated solution
	\item Calculated the trajectory by solving the two-body problem using a numerical differential equation solver built from scratch with Apollo 11 low earth orbit initial conditions
\end{itemize}
